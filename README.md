# UFCModeling
A statistical analysis of UFC fight statistics (2010-current day) using machine learning models and EDA techniques.

Performed exploratory data analysis of UFC fight statistic data with Python and literate programming techniques in JupyterHub, created visualizations and summary statistics to highlighting gender, weight class and fight metrics.
Implemented machine learning models, including decision trees for feature selection, random forest classification with an R-squared accuracy score of 66% predicting winner of a fight, K-Nearest Neighbors Classification with an R-squared accuracy score of 56% predicting if a fight will go the distance.
